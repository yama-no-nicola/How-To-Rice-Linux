# How to Rice Linux
## A comprehensive guide on how to rice your linux setup

This is a test project for me to learn LaTeX. I have a very little actual knowledge about the inner workings of Linux and every derivative OS. Keeping that into account, I very much enjoy the process of ricing my distro of choice and I wished i had a guy that explained what i needed to know in order to customize my system. Instead I had to build my knowledge the old fashioned way, so by reading unrelated books and watching random youtube videos. I hope that if this book ever sees the eye of the public it will help a new Linux user to get accustomed to their new system.

## My system
I am writing this on the same machine I did my first rice on, so an MSI Katana laptop equippedwith:
* 11th gen Intel Core i7 8-core CPU 4.60 GHz
* NVIDIA Geforge RTX 3050 Ti Mobile
* 16GB DDR4
Running:
* Hyperland
* Waybar
* Wofi
