\chapter{Introduction}
Who the fuck am I? Why are you here? And most importantly, should you stay?

\section{What is this book}
This book is something that I wished to find when I started my Linux journey. I have my glorious king Brian Ward to help me with the backend stuff, but what about the frontend? I had to learn all of this stuff on my own, and I feel like I'm not even 1\% there. I hope this book is useful to somebody.

\section{Who is this book aimed at}
If you do not know anything about a Linux system, what the hell are you doing here? Go read "How Linux Works by Brian Ward" immediatly. Or some other documentation until you reach a basic understanding of the system, then come back here. Instead, if you are an experienced Linux user, enough to want to correct me every time you see "Linux" and not "GNU/Linux", then again, what the hell are you doing here? This is a book for unexperienced people, take your experience elsewhere, like my email inbox, so that you can share your knowledge and improve this book written by this complete idiot.
